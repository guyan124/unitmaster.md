**What are Agents?**
In Unit Master, Agents are people who introduce clients to invest in your organisation’s funds. They help bring in new members and support client onboarding and account management.

The Agents List shows all agents registered in the system. From this section, you can add new agents, update their details, or change the agent assigned to a client.
