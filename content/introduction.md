  <summary><strong>Securities/Funds</strong></summary>
  <p><strong>Securities / Funds</strong> is a collective investment scheme where money from many investors is pooled together to purchase short-term, low-risk, and highly liquid debt instruments.

A professional fund manager invests this pooled money in assets such as treasury bills, commercial paper, and fixed deposits. The returns generated from these investments are distributed to the investors, after deducting a management fee.

This structure provides investors with a way to earn a return on their savings while still having easy access to their cash, making it suitable for both individual and institutional investors looking for capital preservation and liquidity.</p>
